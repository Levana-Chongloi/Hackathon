            Judaism is one of the world’s oldest religions, dating back nearly 4,000 years, and is considered to be the original Abrahamic faith (which include Islam and Christianity). As a monotheistic faith, followers of Judaism believe in one God who revealed himself through ancient prophets, including Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Solomon and others.
    
            In addition to a number of sacred texts — the most important of which is the Torah — Jews believe that the Ten Commandments are holy laws handed down to Moses by God. Worldwide, there are about 14 million Jews today, who worship in religious centers known as synagogues.
            
            Throughout their history, Jews have been subject to persecution for their faith, including the deaths of about 6 million Jews during the Holocaust. The history of Judaism is essential to understanding the Jewish faith, which has a rich and influential heritage of law, culture and tradition.

        <p class="headline2">Origin of Judaism </p>
        The origins of Jewish faith are explained throughout the Torah. According to the text, God first revealed himself to a Hebrew man named Abraham, who became known as the founder of Judaism.

        Jews believe that God made a special covenant with Abraham and that he and his descendants were chosen people who would create a great nation.
        
        Abraham’s son Isaac, and his grandson Jacob, also became central figures in ancient Jewish history. Jacob took the name Israel, and his children and future generations became known as Israelites.
        
        More than 1,000 years after Abraham, the prophet Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt after being enslaved for hundreds of years.
        
        According to scriptures, God revealed his laws, known as the Ten Commandments, to Moses at Mt. Sinai.

    <p class="headline3">Jewish Temples</p>
    Around 1000 B.C., King David ruled the Jewish people. His son Solomon built the first holy Temple in Jerusalem, which became the central place of worship for Jews.

The kingdom fell apart around 931 B.C., and the Jewish people split into two groups: Israel in the North and Judah in the South.

Sometime around 587 B.C., the Babylonians destroyed the first Temple and sent many Jews into exile.

A second Temple was built in about 516 B.C. but was eventually destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70.

The destruction of the second Temple was significant because Jewish people no longer had a primary place to gather, so they shifted their focus to worshipping in local synagogues.

        <p class="headline4">Holocaust - Judaism and Persecution</p>
    
        Throughout history, Jewish people have been persecuted for their religious beliefs. Some well-known events include:

    
        <p><b>1066 Granada Massacre:</b> On December 30, 1066, a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in Granada and killed more than 1,000 Jewish families. The group also kidnapped and crucified Joseph ibn Naghrela, the Jewish vizier to the Berber king.</p>
        
        <p><b>The First Crusade:</b> In the first of the Crusades—a series of medieval holy wars involving Christians and Muslims—thousands of Jews were killed, and many were forced to convert to Christianity.</p>
        
        <p><b>The Spanish Expulsion:</b>In 1492, Spain’s rulers issued a royal edict that declared all Jews who refused to convert to Christianity would be expelled from the country. Experts estimate about 200,000 people were ousted and tens of thousands died while trying to reach safety.</p>
        
        <p><b>The Holocaust:</b> In the Holocaust, the most infamous of modern-day atrocities, the Nazis murdered more than 6 million Jews.</p>

      <p class="headline5">Creation of Israel</p>
      Although the United States supported the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which favored the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had assured the Arabs in 1945 that the United States would not intervene without consulting both the Jews and the Arabs in that region. The British, who held a colonial mandate for Palestine until May 1948, opposed both the creation of a Jewish state and an Arab state in Palestine as well as unlimited immigration of Jewish refugees to the region. Great Britain wanted to preserve good relations with the Arabs to protect its vital political and economic interests in Palestine.

     <br> <br>Soon after President Truman took office, he appointed several experts to study the Palestinian issue. In the summer of 1946, Truman established a special cabinet committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Henry F. Grady, an Assistant Secretary of State, who entered into negotiations with a parallel British committee to discuss the future of Palestine. In May 1946, Truman announced his approval of a recommendation to admit 100,000 displaced persons into Palestine and in October publicly declared his support for the creation of a Jewish state. Throughout 1947, the United Nations Special Commission on Palestine examined the Palestinian question and recommended the partition of Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state. On November 29, 1947 the United Nations adopted Resolution 181 (also known as the Partition Resolution) that would divide Great Britain’s former Palestinian mandate into Jewish and Arab states in May 1948 when the British mandate was scheduled to end. Under the resolution, the area of religious significance surrounding Jerusalem would remain a corpus separatum under international control administered by the United Nations.
      
     <br><br>Although the United States backed Resolution 181, the U.S. Department of State recommended the creation of a United Nations trusteeship with limits on Jewish immigration and a division of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab provinces but not states. The State Department, concerned about the possibility of an increasing Soviet role in the Arab world and the potential for restriction by Arab oil producing nations of oil supplies to the United States, advised against U.S. intervention on behalf of the Jews. Later, as the date for British departure from Palestine drew near, the Department of State grew concerned about the possibility of an all-out war in Palestine as Arab states threatened to attack almost as soon as the UN passed the partition resolution.
      
      Despite growing conflict between Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews and despite the Department of State’s endorsement of a trusteeship, Truman ultimately decided to recognize the state Israel.
